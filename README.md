# IntergenDnsDomain
Sets Intergen's DNS suffix first in network's settings

Features
--------
Why should I use this script?

 - If you are using malicious VPN software that constantly changes the order of DNS suffixes in your settings, this script will automatically change the order back to what it should be on Intergenâ€™s network.


Usage
--------
Just run as a PowerShell script. If it was run without admin rights, it will start itself up in a PowerShell instance with admin rights.
